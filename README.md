The goal of **`homoglyph`** is to assist the data analyst working with
data coming from noisy data sources (such as OCR) or with text and web
addressess related to online phishing and fraud.

> **homoglyph** (plural homoglyphs)
> 
> A character identical or nearly identical in appearance to another,
> but which differs in the meaning it represents. from Wiktionary, The
> free dictionary\[1\]

The package contains data and functions for creating, processing and
handling homoglyphs. It also contains data and dictionaries that can be
utilized for automatic character matching.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dmi3kno/homoglyph")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(hocr)
library(tesseract) #install.packages(dmi3kno/tesseract)
library(tidyverse)
library(magick)
```

Lets see if we can produce some homoglyphs from OCR.

``` r
cupcakes <- system.file("extdata", package = "hocr", "peanutbutter.png")

df <- ocr(cupcakes, HOCR = TRUE) %>% 
  hocr_parse() %>% 
  tidy_tesseract()
```

Average confidence score for our text is only 85.1%, so letâ€™s see if we
can improve on this score and create some homoglyphs in the mean time.
We will first aggregate `hocr` to line level.

``` r
df_line <- df %>% select(contains("word"), contains("line")) %>% 
  group_by_at(vars(contains("line"))) %>% 
  mutate(ocrx_line_value=paste(ocrx_word_value, collapse = " "),
         ocrx_line_conf=mean(ocrx_word_conf)) %>%
  group_by(ocrx_line_value, ocrx_line_conf, add = TRUE) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate(ocr_line_geom=bbox_to_geometry(ocr_line_bbox))

test_geom <- df_line %>% filter(ocr_line_id =="line_1_24") %>% pull(ocr_line_geom)

image_read(cupcakes) %>% image_crop(geometry = test_geom)
```
